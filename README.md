# Unit 03: JavaScript: Password Generator

In this assignment, I created an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria.

The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by Javascript.

The following image demonstrates the application functionality:

```
- If I click the "generate" button to generate a password
-> Then I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

- If prompted for the length
-> Then I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

- If prompted for character types
-> Then I can choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

- If all prompts are anwered and at least one character type is selected
-> Then a password is generated and displayed

- If I click the "copy" button
-> Then the password generated is copied to the clipboard

```
